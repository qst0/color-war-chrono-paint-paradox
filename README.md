## It's the final moments HEX year 0xFFFFFE...

...the turn of the mutlichroma-ennium.

Groups of renegade time painters have found a ways to exploit a predicted quantum computing error known as Y2K-0L0R to re-approach the turn of the multichroma-ennium with a disentangled chromo-copy of their most powerful painters.

As a painter approaching what has been predicted to be a full fledged Color War...
It is your task to spread your color.

Showing exceptional skill, you have been chosen to be utilized in the Y2K-0L0R experiment:

Can you out color your strongest opponents?
Can you out color yourself?
